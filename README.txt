    I created three scripts called GridNode, PlayerClickToMove, and GridManager. I worked on the Pathfinder script and used the Manhattan heuristic (4-connected grid). Then I applied all the necessary elements to the scripts, except for GridNode. I made the GridNode script but forgot what I made it for and where to implement it. Right now, it’s just a script on hand, just in case.

  Modified PlayerClickToMove to work with animations. Added script to test and make sure the logic was working via wasd movement, transferred the logic to PlayerClickToMove and then deleted the wasd script entirely.
